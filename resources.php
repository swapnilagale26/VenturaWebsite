          <div class="blogHeading">Designing Challenges in Responsive Learning Development</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>
          <p>Tilt that phone, swipe that content, click the next button- different devices, different actions, different experiences, and how? Responsive Content! Works well for us right, as we switch from one device to another? The YouTube content, most websites, and even eLearning content giving us a seamless experience even when we change those screen sizes, operating systems. Ever wondered how it works? The magic is nothing but the work of Responsive Development. In terms of eLearning (briefly explained) Responsive Learning development creates a single course/project that works well both on Mobile devices and desktops- delivering an optimal experience on both. 
          However, it is easier said than done. The design process requires proper planning to create consistent learning experience across all the target devices. Here are some key designing challenges in Responsive Learning Development.</p><br><br>

          <p><strong>Visualisation</strong><br>
          As shown in the image above, the same eLearning content has to be rendered in different ways on different screens. The challenge here is to design elements, and focus on how it can flow from one screen dimension to another. While Responsive design uses Breakpoints to determine when the format of rendering changes, responsive sketches are required to understand how the pages would look on each device screen which is then implemented using HTML and CSS scripts.<br><br>

          <strong>Navigation</strong><br>
          While the design and position of common navigation buttons are universal, with customisations and creative designing things can become a bit complex. The challenge lies in creating navigation components that are intuitive and self-explanatory. The answer lies in analysing thoroughly the context of learning, i.e. how and when the learning take place, what is the key purpose etc. This helps in creating unique navigation that suits the context. This is the reason why the multi-layered drop-down menus on Desktop version are often replaced with Accordion design on Mobile devices.<br><br>

          <strong>Readability</strong><br>
          While this may seem simple, it still can cause accessibility issues. Imagine text in italics or ones that use colours that affect readability. The various ways to do so in responsive design include the use of ‘em’ units, Percent (%) as CSS font etc. Legibility and readability are the keys to engagement and capturing attention. The font type too plays an essential role in this. While Sans serif fonts have often been the choice, it is advisable to use versatile fonts similar (open source Google fonts) such as Open Sans, Lato, Old Standard TT, Abril Fatface, PT Serif etc. or it is advisable to use Font pairing to find the right combinations using tools like Google Type, Type Connection and Font Pair etc.<br><br>

          <strong>Image Rendering</strong><br>
          What would happen if an image designed for mobile devices were scaled to be rendered on a desktop screen? This should not be the case when content is repurposed in responsive eLearning. In many cases images are used to send the central message which is why this becomes even more important. Making images and icons scalable by using Scripts, SVG and icon fonts, optimizing the rendering through Lazy loading etc. are some tested solutions. <br><br>

          The key challenge however lies in developing a rich Responsive Learning experience that is affected by loading time, web-traffic (for browser based content), slow connectivity etc. Optimised content, conditional loading, and very often a mobile-first approach helps in developing and delivering a great responsive learning experience. </p>

          <div class="blogHeading">Designing Through the Eyes of Learners</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>
          <p>“Put Yourself in their Shoes.” Heard that one more than once, right? In situations where one fails to interpret other’s thoughts, when one is unable to read between the lines or where one ends up creating something that doesn’t serve the purpose. Well, for those who haven’t. Just ask any Instructional designer. Instructional designers more than often are advised to put themselves in the learner’s shoes, to imagine the learner’s situations, learning environment etc. while giving shape to the learning content. Not, surprising considering the fact that in the end of the day learning/training content is for the learners, designed to meet the learning objectives and organisational goals, that of course includes a skilled workforce.</p><br><br>

          <p>
          We often talk about creating engaging, interactive, intuitive learning, learning that fills the gaps, learning that gives a competitive edge over others etc. But, quite often with all those expectations, the learning ends up incomprehensible, in a form that either scares the learners or is completely unrelatable. And the whole strategy can nearly be unsuccessful, just because of that. <br><br>
          So, ideally every learning design should be carried out keeping the learners in core, or through the eyes of the learners. And how can that be done? Here’s how.<br><br>

          <strong>Identify the Must Have Content</strong><br>
          The design aspect essentially begins with content gathering. From the learner’s perspective, it is often too boring to be introduced to the same concepts and information that they are already aware of. Hence, identifying the level of understanding, existing skill-sets and sorting the information as must-have and additional information helps in keeping the learners interested and the learning goal in place too.<br><br>

          <strong>Determine the Visual Focus</strong><br>
          The crucial aspect of visual design is the focus. Where should the learner focus? What should be retained from the page/course. The elements hence, the images text and buttons should be placed in such a way that the object of most importance catches the attention first. This includes text, colours, typography, illustration style etc. It is easier to consider each page of the course as a poster where all the above-mentioned elements have specific roles and emphasis based on the context. <br><br>

          <strong>Utilise the Power of Images (& media)</strong><br>
          Learners today appreciate the use of visuals instead of text and images are touted to be more powerful in terms of communicating the right message. However, a bit of description can add value to the just images. Infographics, videos on the other hand speak for themselves, and require much less additional (in this case textual) inputs.<br><br>

          <strong>Avoid Cluttering</strong><br>
          As a learner, having so many things to focus on can be a bit overwhelming and confusing too. Designing for the learners should be about organising information sequentially, broken onto easily digestible chunks, and arranged so that the whole learning can be processed, understood and retained. It should be almost similar to telling a story, starting from the end wouldn’t work always. And in case of learning content reverse engineering may not be the best way about, unless it is about assembling a product (you get the gist right).<br><br>

          But, all this becomes possible only when we understand the learning environment and the audience well. Always consider the learning environment where the learning content is to be utilised.  In a regular training set up the device of choice could be a desktop, however with the growth of mobile workforce, BYOP and such, mobile devices too have become popular for learning delivery. The screen size often determines the amount of content that can be displayed at once or on a single page. Similarly, the learner demography too plays a role in the whole learning design process, while the newer generation may find illustrations interesting, it may not always be the case with veterans similarly in case of using game-like scenarios that some may relate to and some may not. Apart from these there are various other aspects that vary according to the group of learners. So, the groundwork or the analysis, requirement gathering phase requires lot of attention to create/conceptualise designs that suit the learners. <br><br>

          So, how would you design through the eyes of learners? Do share your thoughts.

          <div class="blogHeading">Behavioural Learning vs. Cognitive Learning</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>
          <p>Learning theories are the foundation of effective learning implementations. The learning content creation is the result of application of learning theories to deliver best learning experiences to the learners, a part usually handled by the instructional designers. There are 3 schools of thought otherwise known as learning theories: Behavioural Learning, Cognitive Learning and Constructive Learning, and like with all theories, more than often there are debates, discussions as on which is better. </p><br><br>

          <p>
          Here we shall discuss the first two, i.e. behavioural learning vs. cognitive learning. <br><br>

          <strong>Behavioural Learning </strong>as the title suggests, considers learning as a behaviour. Learning here is an entity that can be measured in terms of behavioural change. The theory originates from B.F. Skinner’s study about the concept of operant conditioning, a concept that states that learning occurs through rewards and punishments for behaviour. <br><br>

          
          Behavioural Learning hence is basically any change in behaviour due to the environmental changes or stimuli. The learning begins when the learners starts behaving or responding to a stimulus in a particular manner and that is repeated over and over under similar conditions. Basically, it is the result, reward or consequence that triggers the behaviour or action. Instructors often use Behaviourism when they reward learner behaviour.<br><br>

          Applications of Behavioural learning is often seen in Reinforced Learning, Compliance Training (where rules are established), Gamification etc. <br><br>
        
          Behavioural Learning however lacks in terms of problem solving and creativity. Learners fail to act in response to new situations or change actions accordingly. The only situations they are prepared for are based on basic facts and the responses associated to those.<br><br>

          Moving on to <strong>Cognitive Learning.</strong> The credit for Cognitive learning theories goes to Jean Piaget. Theoretically speaking learning here is the result of processing the information received, rather than just responding to stimuli. Thinking or thought process is the key here. The learning here is also manifested as behaviour change but it isn’t the only indicator of the process. The actual skills and knowledge are stored in the learner’s mind.<br><br>

          The stored knowledge is used when the learner sets out to understand and process new information that (s)he receives and then correlates it with the existing understanding/knowledge stored in the brain.  Unlike Behavioural learning, cognitive learning is an internal process and isn’t merely triggered by an external stimulus. Rather than observable behaviour, learning through thought analysis etc. are given importance. Change in behaviour is recorded as a shift in thought. The actual learning according to the cognitive model is the result of actual experiences.  <br><br>

          Applications of cognitive learning is seen in microlearning, branched scenario-based learning, real world examples, collaborative learning etc. The learning environment plays less important role here. <br><br>

          Behavioural learning may fade out due to lack of response to stimuli over time, this hence requires regular revisions. Cognitive learning on the other hand can be recalled easily depending on the way it is compartmentalised or chunked. <br><br>

          While both the learning theories have its own perks, it’s a blend of both that works best in the modern learning scenario. <br><br>

          So, which method of learning would you opt for? Do share your thoughts.

          <div class="blogHeading">Tips for L&D Managers to Calculate ROI on eLearning</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>
          <p>Profits, Turnaround etc. are terms associated with most businesses, and the same applies for investments in eLearning. As mentioned in the eBook- Calculating eLearning ROI In A Corporate Set-Up Where L&D Is A Support Function, “Quantifying and calculating eLearning ROI in a corporate set-up where L&D is a support function, may seem easy. After all it is about calculating the value of the total cost of investment by adding the costs incurred during various stages of developing eLearning course.” </p><br><br>

          <p>The role of L&D managers is crucial when it comes to such calculations. While various parameters influence the ROI, a few tips can come in handy when L&D managers have to calculate the ROI on eLearning.  <br><br>


          <ul>
            <li>Tip 1# Don’t Misinterpret <br> The market usually runs on the basis of comparison. However, when it comes to calculating ROI this may lead to misinterpretations. Each investment has a different form of cost and returns, and this differs for every organisation, every eLearning type, the learning strategy, the learning group etc. ROI is affected by these and hence the calculation should account for these too.</li><br><br>
            <li>Tip2# Consider the Time Duration <br> ROI calculation in eLearning is time sensitive. The returns usually take time to manifest and so, wait for a certain time gap after the eLearning is delivered. Also, as for other businesses, the results of eLearning need not always manifest as monetary growth, as it focuses more on filling skill-gap, bringing in behaviour change and making learners proactive, the returns in terms of profit and turn-around can be calculated only after a certain time. </li><br><br>
            <li>Tip3# Account for other Parameters<br> While calculating ROI on eLearning, L&D managers should also consider the various other parameters, including the market fluctuations, changes at the work, or overall work pressure on the learners. All these parameters play key role in how effective the eLearning turns out to be.</li>
          </ul><br><br>
          <p>While L&D Managers usually opt for eLearning considering all the cost-benefit aspects, the down-time requirements, and even the additional infrastructural requirements. Understanding that measuring the results and returns accurately requires accounting for various aspects that influence the learning progression is the key to its success. The Kirkpatrick’s learning evaluation model, that accounts for Learner’s Reaction, Learning Results, Learner Behaviour and Business Results is by far the most comprehensive evaluation model used in the industry. The Phillips ROI Methodology on the other hand calculates the Cost-Benefit Ration and ROI in more quantitative terms. A combination of both can hence give a clearer picture about how effective or ineffective a learning strategy or eLearning investment really is. <br><br>

          
          So, which model of evaluation do you prefer?<br><br>

          <div class="blogHeading">How to Leverage Video Learning in Corporate Workplace</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>
          <p>A 3-year-old, unlocks my smartphone (pattern lock and all) opens YouTube and says, “what do you watch it is all about Kitchen and stuff (duh! I binge watch cooking videos so what?).” Unsatisfied with feed he asks me to search for Peppa Pig (smarty pants doesn’t know how to spell). The rest of the hour is spent watching various episodes without any assistance from my end. That is the power of ‘Videos’. </p><br><br>

          <p>
          According to <a style="color: blue" target="_blank" href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html">Cisco’s Visual Networking Index</a>, by 2019, the global consumer Internet video traffic will account for 80 percent of all consumer Internet traffic, and this doesn’t even include video exchanged through peer-to-peer (P2P). Well, videos are here to stay and there is nothing that says otherwise. And interestingly enough, the millennials are hooked to videos. It is self-driven, pervasive and has higher retention, making it a great channel for delivering corporate learning. <br><br>

          So, how do we leverage video learning in corporate workplace? Here are a few tips.<br><br>

          <strong>Create strong Impressions with Short Videos</strong><br>
          That is exactly how advertisements work. The aim is to create a lasting impression in a very short time. Short videos are great tools for performance support or just-in-time learning where a specific topic or question needs to be answered while on the job. Videos are effective as it can be delivered on mobiles seamlessly and hence are easily accessible. <br><br>

          <strong>Elaborate Topics with Explainer Videos</strong><br>
          DIY videos are quite popular these days, from home decor to rocket design you can find everything on the world-wide web. Such videos are explanative, providing a step by step process in an easily understandable manner. Trainings about new products or processes can be delivered using explainer videos, scenarios that resemble real-life situations can help the learners relate better with the learning.<br><br>

          <strong>Provide an explorative space with Interactive Videos</strong><br>
          Videos earlier were passive and the only physical interaction used to be the clicking of play, pause or stop button. The interactions that happened were usually at an emotional mental level, where thought process was initiated or curiosity increased. <br><br>
        
          However, interactive video is the new face of videos, that takes it from a passive activity to a more active one. Take a look at this interactive video where a few clicks change the life of a child (<a style="color: blue" target="_blank" href="http://www.giveafullerlife.com/">Give a Fuller Life</a>). While it has been prevalently used for marketing ad-campaigns, music videos and in healthcare training. Corporates too can leverage the potential of interactive videos by designing videos where learners can interact, explore and learn as a result of those interactions. <br><br>

          Videos have great potential. From recreating real-life scenarios, to real-time learning delivery (live feeds, vodcasts), with proper conferencing facilities, live chats video-based learning is a great medium for corporate training to keep the learners up-to-speed and increase their efficiency. The best part about videos is that it can be created easily without much expertise too, hence reducing both the cost and time. Equipment’s too are readily available for creating basic level video courses for ready use. <br><br>

          Video-based learning has better retention and more chances of being application, hence making it a popular choice amongst corporate L&D providers. <br><br>

          So, have you tried video-based training yet? <br><br>

          <div class="blogHeading">Does Localised eLearning Connect Better with Your eLearners?</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          According to <a style="color: blue" target="_blank" href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/4760701/global-e-learning-market-analysis-and-trends">Research and Markets</a> “The Global E-Learning Market is poised to grow at a CAGR of around 7.2% over the next decade to reach approximately $325 billion by 2025.” The eLearning market is growing and has gained a global level acceptance. This also indicates the widespread use of eLearning across countries, or regions irrespective of the language used. <br><br>

          So, how do we leverage video learning in corporate workplace? Here are a few tips.<br><br>

          <i>But, do all countries in the world use English as the first language?</i><br><br>
          Well, as Wikipedia puts it, “In some countries where English is not the most spoken language, it is an official language.” So, essentially eLearning works just fine with English as the main language. However, if we were to recall Benjamin Lee Whorf’s idea about language’s power over the mind, would that mean localised eLearning would be better. There have been various studies that point out that learning is different in different parts of the world, where some might learn better through facts and figures and some through examples. <br><br>

          Localisation however, is not just about the language. It includes various other cultural aspects specific to different regions. So, when we talk about localised eLearning it includes, date and time formats, currencies, the regional norms for graphic elements (including dressing norms and such), region specific slangs and examples, and importantly the legal and social regulations. <br><br>

          Localised content provides a wider outreach, but more importantly it creates a better connect with the learners. <a style="color: blue" href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pTiNAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248&dq=we+do+after+all+acquire+certain+habits+of+thought+that+shape+our+experience+in+significant+and+often+surprising+ways.&source=bl&ots=vTjw13Nsgc&sig=cdTPIaWoAvZyKJ-iXI0xgvdL3dc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXvJC6mODVAhUFLo8KHVm2BAQQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=we%20do%20after%20all%20acquire%20certain%20habits%20of%20thought%20that%20shape%20our%20experience%20in%20significant%20and%20often%20surprising%20ways.&f=false" target="_blank">New research has revealed</a> that, “when we learn our mother tongue, we do after all acquire certain habits of thought that shape our experience in significant and often surprising ways.” It doesn’t come as a surprise that many learning and development experts emphasise on the aspect of creating eLearning in the way eLearners want it to be. Localised eLearning is observed to be more relatable by the eLearners, and this in turn assists in better learning, retention and application.  It is also known that in some parts of the world, the what the characters in an eLearning course look like or wear has significant social influence, and can be considered impolite if the guidelines are not followed. Localised eLearning takes care of such aspects too. Localised content creates a level playing ground for all the employees of the organization, no matter which part of the globe they are in. It also ensures that the learning content delivers the same message to all the eLearners, irrespective of the language and cultural preferences.<br><br>
        
          Localised eLearning is also beneficial for organisations in terms of cost and time. As the core content remains same, the cost of conceptualising and designing eLearning has to be occurred only once, what comes after is just the cost for translation and localisation. And as localised content are better absorbed and retained, the cost of additional training, and the time that has to be usually spent at retraining is reduced to a great extent. <br><br>

          Localised eLearning goes one step closer to Personalisation. Where learners can learn in the language of choice, in the regional slangs they are more accustomed to. This also paves the way for self-paced learning, wherein learning becomes a learner driven process rather than being a mandatory must-have training.<br><br>

          <div class="blogHeading">How Well-designed Illustrations can help storytelling in eLearning</div>
          <div class="introImage" ></div>

          <p>
          ‘Once upon the time’ or ‘Long-long ago’, most of us grew up reading at least a couple of stories that began with those standard lines. Gradually the once non-illustrated books started becoming less popular and illustrated stories took its place. The most millennials will agree that life would have been quite different without Marvel and DC’s illustrative comics. Something similar works for eLearning too. <br><br>

          Illustrations (and media) often play a crucial role in enhancing what we call the user experience, engagement and even learning and retention. Where does storytelling fit in? Storytelling has often been considered a good way to introduce complex learning concepts and allows the learners to learn in stages as the story progresses. Goes without saying that illustrations can add the quality of storytelling, with images allowing the learners to visualize the entire scenario. <br><br>

          Listed below are other ways in which well-designed illustrations help storytelling in eLearning. <br><br>

          <strong>Instantly Connects with Learners</strong>
          A good illustration always leaves a good impression. This works for illustrative storytelling in eLearning too. Using illustration styles that the user group can connect with better (caricatures, cartoons etc.). Take for instance, a story-based eLearning module for using a newly acquired machinery. Illustrations definitely help the learners identify it better, and also in understanding the functionalities. <br><br>


          <strong>Makes Concepts Simpler</strong>
          The scenarios or situations within the stories used in eLearning often break down the concepts into simpler versions. When supported by relevant and contextual illustrations, the stories make more sense. Abstract concepts often make more sense when presented alongside with visual examples. Illustrations also assist in giving a quantitative representation to unquantifiable concepts, creating a level playing ground for comparison, pattern analysis etc. <br><br>

          <strong>Makes Learning Engaging</strong>
          Image/illustration has its own perks. A story if entirely textual can end up being boring too, however with the mix of the right amount of illustration it becomes more interesting and can keep the learners engaged for longer. Retention is also said to comparatively improve with the incorporation of right illustrations within the eLearning. <br><br>

          Illustrated Story telling model can be used to create infographics, or as videos with no voice-overs- i.e. only images and music, or as a series of comic-book-style drawings, still or in motion all to tell stories with little or no text at all. Add to those a bit of interaction and the learners have actions to perform and outcomes to look forward to.  <br><br>

          Utilization of globally accepted signs and symbols as illustrations, can assist in addressing multi-lingual learners without going back for translation each time a new learner group is added to the learning circle. This also works quite well in areas with low-literacy. Illustrative stories can send out the information just as well as explanative video-based modules, as long as the illustrations are well-designed. <br><br>
        
          The key however, lies in balancing between the right amount of text and the right amount of illustrations to bring out the best from storytelling.

          <div class="blogHeading">Flash to HTML5 Conversion - Cost VS Benefits</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          There is no doubt that Flash has been replaced by HTML5. That too, not just in web-based applications but in eLearning too. Various convertors, eLearning authoring tools and specialised eLearning vendors have gained popularity because of the sudden surge in Flash to HTML5 conversion. While the benefits of switching to Flash are multi-fold, most organisations/companies expect to see the benefits in terms of ROI or Cost Vs. Benefits. <br><br>

          Well, eLearning has different parameters for measuring the benefits and hence cannot always be equated in terms of monetary value, and hence the popular cost-benefit analysis tools can be of little use. Instead, we can compare on aspect that are visible and can be charted. <br><br>

          <strong>Development Cost</strong><br>
          There is a certain amount of cost associated with converting Flash based eLearning to HTML5. First off all it involves collection of all the available content, analysing the learning requirements, extracting the content from Flash etc. requires resources, time, expertise, additional assets for HTML5 conversion etc. This also includes the actual development cost i.e. of instructional designer, developer, authoring tool etc. <br><br>

          The question then is what benefits does it offer?<br><br>

          Flash to HTML5 conversion is often a one-time investment. And once the conversion is done it can be a long-term asset. It is also considered to be a step towards future-proofing as courses in HTML5 are usually multi device ready. The cost for future modifications is hence cut-down. <br><br>
        
          <strong>Cost of Authoring Tool or Software Licenses</strong><br>
          This is a cost that one needs to incur if in-house development is being considered. However, the purchase or licensing cost is minimal in comparison to full-fledged eLearning outsourcing. <br><br>

          <strong>Vendor Cost</strong><br>
          In case your organisation lacks the expertise in content creation, eLearning authoring or conversion then it is advisable to invest on a good eLearning vendor. While the selection process often takes time, good eLearning vendors make the rest easier by understanding the requirements well, and devising solutions that can be most effective. In case of Flash to HTML5 conversion too, experienced vendors may take lesser time and have flexible costing models too. <br><br>

          Outsourcing offers great benefits in terms of good quality output, saving time and effort, the cost that would otherwise go in training or recruiting eLearning professionals etc. It also allows the organisation to focus on its key responsibilities while eLearning vendors take care of the learning requirements. <br><br>

          Different organisations have different learning needs and this applies even when it comes to converting existing Flash-based learning to HTML5. While some organisations may have flexible policies that promote constant technological updates and so Flash to HTML5 may come as a ready choice as well as critical requirement. In the other hand, certain organisations may have a stringent policy and use older version of browsers to support the in-house applications and in such cases Flash to HTML5 conversion may not be required at all. So, before setting out analyse the requirements well, which can be the best way to minimise cost after all.

          <div class="blogHeading">3 Reasons Why You Must Convert Flash to HTML5</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          Corporate workspaces today consist of employees from different demographic. From the Baby boomers to the millennials and Generation Z. Ask the latter about Flash, and they would probably say, “Eh... Grant Gustin, or maybe the fastest man on Earth (pun not intended). There is no denying that the glorious years of Flash (technology) has long passed, and newer more advanced technological counterparts have taken its place. <br><br>

          HTML5 has now taken front seat in media deployment across browsers, interactivity and all included. To cut the long story short, the decline of flash that began with the arrival of newer advanced devices, hastened by the famous Apple Vs. Flash debacle, further heightened by the incompatibility on mobile devices, culminated with Adobe renaming Flash Professional as Adobe Animate CC. That being said, then what about Flash-based eLearning? What needs to be done now. While some organisations opt for a complete makeover by recreating eLearning in new formats, some go for tool-based Flash to HTML5 conversion. Either ways, the output is mostly HTML5 based multi-functional eLearning that adapts to current learning needs. Still considering Flash to HTML5 conversion? Here are 3 quintessential reasons as to why you must do so.  <br><br>

          <ol type="1">
            <li>Compatibility <br> We witness the launch of a new handheld device almost every fortnight. Goes without saying that with BYOD on the board, those devices have penetrated the corporate workplace and subsequently influence the eLearning space too. Flash is restricted to desktops and laptops and not compatible with touch-based devices (smartphones and other smart devices). Whereas, courses created on HTML5 can be run on any device. Also, while Flash based courses require an additional Flash Plug-in for running on various browsers, HTML5 based courses can function well irrespective of the OS. And not just that HTML5 overcomes the barrier put up by multiple Device-OS combinations.</li><br><br>
            <li>Anytime, Anywhere Access<br> This may be an extension to the compatibility factor, but also includes aspects related to connectivity, file size etc. Optimised HTML5 courses run far more smoothly (loading, processing and all) in comparison with the Flash counterparts. Initially, it lacked in a few interactivities, but this has now been taken care of. Multimedia integration is easier with HTML5 and can be accessed from anywhere, depending on connectivity. Not just that HTML5 also supports offline storage hence, truly giving access to learning 24X7. </li><br><br>
            <li>Customisability<br> Now this may be considered as the greatest perk of HTML5- it is open source and hence can be customised at various levels, whereas Flash is a proprietary software owned by Adobe, hence making it less flexible to changes or modifications. In other technical terms (according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" style="color: blue" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>), “HTML5 introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications, and is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.” The closed integration in turn strengthens the security aspect which still remains as an unresolved issue in Flash. </li>
          </ol><br><br>

         <p> At a global level, Flash has already been replaced by HTML5. Flash based advertisements were converted to HTML5 before being displayed on most browsers. Initially Google based Flash to HTML5 converter Swiffy was available to convert SWF files. Currently such content conversion is handled by Google’s Web Designer, Adobe Animate CC, Haxe, FlexJS and many other tools, clearly pointing at one aspect, which is ‘better late than never’.

          <div class="blogHeading">Reformatting Learning in the Modern Workplace</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          We live in the 21st Century!<br><br>

          How often is this used as a catchphrase to emphasise changes, technological advances, changing demographic in workplaces, the transition in organizational learning goals, the shifting priorities and most of all the way in which devices have become an integral part of the day to day functions. As the workplace evolves with time, so does the learning/training strategy. The traditional ways of workplace learning no longer fit the frame and need reformatting to meet the needs of the modern workplace. 


         Jane Hart, the Founder of the Centre for Learning & Performance Technologies, <a style="color: blue" target="_blank" href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/blog/2016/01/02/2016-rethinking-workplace-learning/">summarises learning in the modern workplace</a>, as a mindset that recognises learning as a part of the normal workflow, a mindset that appreciates the fact that learners learn for themselves, as a mindset that values workplace learning in all forms, one that realises that it is not just about tracking and reporting and that understands that the world is changing and that too at a fast pace.<br><br>

          So, what does the L&D (learning and development) department do now?<br><br>

          While there is still a lot on their plate, workplace learning is no longer the sole responsibility of L&D. It has been reformatted and has now become a more holistic endeavour where the learners, managers, L&D team, all those who are part of the daily interactions have a role to play. Workplace learning is now more of a socio-collaborative activity, wherein eLearning plays the supportive role by sharing inputs as and where required. <br><br>

          Learners now take initiative to learn and share knowledge which in turn is supported at an organisational level by cultivating and open culture. This works in form of knowledge sharing portals, discussion boards, chats etc. Social media too plays an important role as it connects more easily with the modern learners, act as channel where they can effortlessly discuss and share content in many formats. <br><br>

         The role of managers and L&D team has changed from that of learning management to a more motivational category. Apart from planning training schedules and such, they now have to create an environment that supports learning. This happens not just through pep talks, but by putting flexible policies in place that make the learners feel more at ease. From encouraging a collaborative solution finding mindset to building a team to handle social learning and knowledge collaboration to creating the trend self-paced learning across the organisation, the role of L&D managers and even team leads needs a versatile twist. <br><br>
        
         The L&D’s key roles now needs a shift from just learning creation to that of learning innovation. They need to device ways to utilize the benefits of mobile learning, incorporate microlearning and performance support tools in the learning strategy. Transform learning from a face-to-face trainer driven process to a more.  <br><br>

         The transition from traditional workplace learning to modern workplace learning begins in small groups. Teams that promote queries, discussions in a professional environment, with channels that allow communication across the entire organisation and eLearning support to find information that is needed at the point of need.<br><br>

         Modern workplace is all about such flexibility, making employees feel at home to increase productivity, retention etc. and learning here is all about the seamless experience of interaction, communication, sharing, understanding and implementing.

          <div class="blogHeading">Learning Experience Designer VS Instructional Designer</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          Instructional Designer! Even newbies in the eLearning Industry must be well acquainted with this term. We know them as the brains behind eLearning, the ones who give life to most eLearning courses. But what do they do really? <br><br>

          Instructional Designer is the one who follow the practices of instructional design to create eLearning. So, then what does a Learning Experience Designer do? How do the profiles differ? <br><br>

          Let’s explore a bit.<br><br>

          <strong>Instructional Designer</strong>
          According to Wikipedia, “Instructional design (ID), or instructional systems design (ISD), is the practice of creating instructional experiences which make the acquisition of knowledge and skill more efficient, effective, and appealing. There are many instructional design models, but many are based on the ADDIE model with the five phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation.” By definition an instructional designer focuses on creating instructional experiences. The emphasis here is mostly on the instruction and the instructor (or trainer, teacher, facilitator), the mode of instruction. While engagement aspects are given priority the whole strategy usually revolves around the organisation’s learning environment.<br><br>

          Instructional Designers focus on the behavioral and cognitive psychology. They usually follow a system, a rule-based approach and select the technology that fits the content delivery requirement.<br><br>

          Instructional design has been around for decades and has evolved over the time, whereas Learning Experience Design is a relatively new concept. With the changing times however, the role of instructional designers too has greatly changed. As  <a style="color: blue" href="https://elearningindustry.com/gaze-into-the-future-of-learning-with-connie-malamed" target="_blank"> Connie Malamed </a> once said, “in the future, Instructional Designers, in addition to creating courses for a specific user profile, would also begin to play a crucial role in enabling learning via online communities, social media technologies, curating content, and providing guidance to faculty and teaching experts on how to generate more relevant content.” This couldn’t be truer. Instructional designers now have to look at the broader picture, UX design and learner experience included, more or less overlapping with the profile of Learning Experience designers.<br><br>
        
          To understand that we have to know what the Learning experience designers do differently.<br><br>

          <strong>Learning Experience Designer</strong>
          While some experts define learning experience design as a new form of Instructional design. The experts at learningexperiencedesign.com, strongly argue that, it is quite different. According to them, “Learning experience design is the process of creating learning experience that enable the learner to achieve the desired learning outcome in a human centered and goal-oriented way. Learning experience designers always put the learner in the center of the experience. This results in a different design where the needs and preferences of the learner are leading.”<br><br>


          In other words, learning experience designers focus on creating an experience in a holistic manner. It covers both Instructional design and user experience design and the principles and models used here mostly focus on creating learning that is engaging, relevant and informative. The approach begins and ends with the users/learners/target audience, in reference with the learning environment, this makes it different from instructional design. <br><br>

          Also Known as the Learning Architects or Learning Designers, learning experience designers work to create cohesive learning. According to <a style="color: blue" href="https://elearningindustry.com/gaze-into-the-future-of-learning-with-connie-malamed" target="_blank"> Connie Malamed</a>, “Learning Experience Design implies a user-centric and holistic approach to solutions. It is a focus on experience and context more than materials. This is not just a change in title, but a change in how we perceive our mission, responsibility and practices. In addition, learning experience designers are thinking about ways to measure and evaluate performance in the workplace using data analytics. There is new interest in revealing valuable data about: activities that can be tracked, the best approaches for changing behavior, preventable errors, and so much more.” <br><br>

          As discussed above, though Instructional designers and Learning experience designers are experiencing an overlap in their roles mostly due to the varied learning requirements in the 21st century, both roles are distinct in their own ways. While defining the distinction precisely may be difficult, the actual difference can only be analysed in practice. <br><br>

          So, how would you define the role within the scope of your organisation? Do share your thoughts.

          <div class="blogHeading">Ideas to Promote Internal Training Amongst Your Employees </div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          How often has an eLearning launch gone south in your organisation? Grumbling users, dissatisfied ones, the unenthusiastic learners and so on, a workplace consists of them all. How do you then ensure that the learning strategy is successful?  How do you prep the learners towards an organisational level change?<br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>Discuss <br> The best way to start with promotions is to discuss it from the start. Have regular conversations with the learners/employees about learning, skill-gaps, expected learning strategies. Gather inputs from them and understand their expectations. Also, understand what kind of learning would appeal to them. </li><br><br>
            <li>Leave Bread Crumbs<br> While the discussion is on, drop subtle hints, short chunks of the content itself to garner interest. This sort of builds up curiosity amongst the learners. It might even trigger positive and negative discussions amongst the audience. Managers and L&D can monitor those to understand what needs to be improved and identify the aspects that hit the right note. </li><br><br>
            <li>Utilise the Power of Communication<br> Communication channel within the organisation may be by far the easiest way to get the news across. But, the internal promotion isn’t just about telling the employees about the new learning model or the introduction of eLearning. Allow them to participate in marketing activities like, creating the emailer or poster. You can also gamify the whole promotional activity using the communication channel, discussion boards etc. </li><br><br>
            <li>Use Live Presentations<br> Make the whole promoting internal training thing an event. Organise an in-house launch where the key stakeholders could present their viewpoints about the whole eLearning idea. Have creative contests that involves the learners getting introduced to eLearning. Gather feedbacks. You could also involve the employees in creating live-video courses, DIY videos, explainer videos etc. </li><br><br>
            <li>Distribute Promotional Content<br> While this may be the most common method, it still has its perks. Say for instance, outreach to all global locations. Create emails with promotional banners and testimonials, circulate images of happy learners, create portals for peer-to-peer discussions about the same. Avoid heavy text-based material, make use of illustrations, typography etc. to capture attention. </li><br><br>
            <li>Let them Know the Perks<br>Just as a part of the promotional activities, highlight the primary benefits of the internal training. Use scenarios and explanations to make different learner groups understand how the learning can influence their work and performance. Tell them about the time saving, effort saving etc. that it could bring about, about the ease of use, how it could improve the workflow and most importantly what personal benefits the learners can gain, how it could help them improve their individual skill-sets and boost moral values too.</li>
            </ul><br><br>

            <p>However, all the promotional activities and the engaging activities can only be successful when the actual content is engaging, intuitive and meets the mark. The learners of today may not always fall for the packaging and hence, the internal training should deliver what it offers.  <br><br>

            What are your thoughts on promoting internal training amongst the employees? Do share your opinion.

          <div class="blogHeading">Quick Tips to Consider Before Starting a Rapid Authoring Project</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          Things are fast paced in this millennium, no doubting that! From Content gathering to analysis to development, everything needs to be done in a pace hitherto imagined, all thanks to the increased demand for content and the rapid speed in which it has to be updated. While custom development has its perks, it is relatively time consuming and hence doesn’t always come as a first choice for organisations looking for a quick rollout. <br><br>

          However, as easy as it sounds Rapid authoring too requires through planning to deliver the right outputs. Based on our experience with tool-based, rapid development. Here are some quick tips to consider before getting started with your Rapid Authoring Project.<br><br>

          <ol type="1">
            <li>Invest Time on Finding the Right Authoring Tool <br> Well begun is half-done, and in case of Rapid Authoring the trick lies in choosing the right authoring tool. It is good to try out a few before coming to a conclusion. This allows to not only check the customisability and flexibility that the tool offers, but also analyse the kind of skill-sets or additional expertise required for using the authoring tool to its best. Also, look for additional assets that it offers- image library, animation pre-sets and all before finalising. This process may be time-consuming, but it is better to choose wisely than going for a change after getting started with the project.</li><br><br>
            <li>Look for a Template that can be Reused (customisable too)<br> With the authoring tool finalised and assuming the data gathering, and analysis is in process, choosing a template becomes the priority. Look for a template that can be customised, i.e. image- text space rearrangements, buttons, colours etc. as required. This helps in being future-ready too, as the same template (with branding requirements and all), can be used for any additional course to be created. </li><br><br>
            <li>Gather all the Reusable Content (content repurposing)<br> In cases where new eLearning is being created, it is advisable to look for existing content if any that can be reused, or restructured. Look for images, videos, etc that can be directly used or used in parts, textual content too (PDFs and Word files), lesson plans from Classroom training can be used as raw inputs and for storyboarding. This saves time and also allows to reuse something that the learners are already accustomed to.</li><br><br>
            <li>Create a Good Storyboard (directly importable)<br> With the content and all necessary inputs gathered at one place, the next step is to create a storyboard that matches the requirement. For this a thorough requirement analysis is required which includes not only the learning needs but also clear understanding about the target audience, the kind of learning they are accustomed to, the technical expertise (related to device usage) etc. Some authoring tools even have provision for storyboarding which makes the development process tad bit simpler as the data can be directly imported into the authoring tool and used. </li>
          </ol><br><br>

        <p>  Rapid authoring is cost effective and doesn’t require expert skill-sets for getting started with. Specific customisations however, may require additional coding skills to get the expected output. Even if you are new to the whole concept, the abovementioned tips can give you a head start. <br><br>

          <div class="blogHeading">How Is L&D Community Coping Up with New Trends in Learning?</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          Digital technology, transformations, learning strategy, delivery mechanisms, mobile evolution and so on. The L&D community is forever exposed to changes and adapting to those. Each year new market trends are announced as a response to the technological advancements, change in learner behavior or the learning environment, the role of L&D professionals here is multifaceted. From analysing the trends to keeping the team updated to handling trainings if necessary and to create the right solutions, the L&D community is often neck-deep in the whole learning development process and more. <br><br>

          But, how exactly does the versatile community in learning & development cope up with the new trends in learning? Here’s how.<br><br>

          <strong>Staying Updated About the Trends</strong><br><br>
          The key role of an L&D professional and the community is to stay in loop with the latest changes, trends, updates etc. This also includes knowing the global economy, the economic shifts, the investment strategies that can benefit L&D. It is almost synonymous to knowing the clients/buyers, the requirements and the factors leading to those requirements.  <br><br>

          The evolving device ecosystems talks about AI integrations, influence of Big data in learning etc. are few trends to watch out for. The ones that influence the learning ecosystem the most. Similarly, the changing demographic, workforce and workplace policies are trends to look out for. <br><br>

          <strong>Understanding the Trends</strong><br><br>
          Knowing the trends is one thing but understanding them is entirely a different ball game. This stage is something that tests the competency of the professionals in the L&D community. The understanding usually comes through discussions, knowledge sharing, reading blogs articles etc. is a great way too. <br><br>
        
          The key is to analyse it objectively and subjectively without being scared about its enormity or impact. The past experiences, the learning accumulated over the years also helps in coping with the sudden trend changes in a positive manner. For L&D community facing the trends head-on is the only way to stay competent. <br><br>

          <strong>Embracing the Trends</strong><br><br>
          Understanding the trends is essential for utilising it. So, once the L&D community is well acquainted with the latest trends, comes the most crucial part- the solutioning. This involves discussions, idea generation, conceptualisations followed by debates, changes- modifications of the ideas and then creating a list of how the trend can be employed to generate the best value output. <br><br>

          While many future trends like AI, machine learning etc. may sound threatening to the L&D community, the key is to understand that technology can be manipulated to assist, but making it function independently without human intervention, that too in learning would be a bit too farfetched as of now. <br><br>

          L&D community is the one that has to constantly learn, unlearn, re-learn, adapt, maintain and balance the organisational learning system. Learning strategies, technologies etc. are often a reflection of the latest trends to stay updated in the ever-competitive market. For the L&D community trends are not just about changes or vision, it is more about adapting, about finding the best ways to use the trends. <br><br>

          So, no matter how futuristic, complex and unapproachable the trends may seem, for the L&D community it is more about surviving by breaking down the complexities, churning out the aspects that can be reciprocated in learning development for creating learning solutions that withstand the winds of change.

          <div class="blogHeading">Challenges in HTML5 Development (And Resolutions)</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          HTML5 (<i>or Hyper Text Markup Language 5, if you call it so</i>) has been the talk of the town even before the demise of Flash, more in the eLearning circle if one must add. The whole multi device boom added to the growing popularity and suddenly HTML5 became the next big thing. HTML5 offers a cost-effective multi-platform development, delivers consistent output across multiple browser, offers offline browsing and better use of mobile features. If that doesn’t make it a good choice enough, eLearning authoring tools too offer an HTML5 output making it a crowd favourite amongst L&D professionals. <br><br>

          But, as with any other development language, HTML5 too packs its share of challenges (<i>some related to screen resolutions too</i>). Let’s take a closer look at those challenges and some solutions too. <br><br>

          <strong>#1- Animations</strong><br><br>
          Undoubtedly when it comes to learning modules animations have become an essential component. HTML5 uses different technology for creating animations and one common challenge here is in getting the audio and video sync right. Creating animations using HTML5 elements (e.g. Canvas, SVG), CSS3, or Spritesheet animations etc. is often more time consuming. However, with the arrival of new development tools (<i>authoring tools</i>) animations in HTML5 poses much less of an issue. <br><br>

          <strong>#2-Code Visibility</strong><br><br>

          Using HTML5 technology as standalone, often leaves traces in terms of cached files on the user machine. This means that the application’s presentation format and even business logic lies exposed. With a little know-how, users can access all JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files and view code too. While certain portions can be masked, trained individuals can easily unmask those. Encryption doesn’t really help to safeguard the HTML5 content, because browsers cannot render that encrypted content.  <br><br>

          Developers minify or obfuscate the code to prevent this. However, using an authoring tool for creating HTML5 content solves this easily, and so does using a Learning management system.<br><br>
        
          <strong>#3- Browsers</strong><br><br>
          Different devices, multiple browsers and the unending permutations of browsers and Operating systems, sounds as a challenge doesn’t it? HTML5 performance hinges greatly on the browsers. So, essentially Chrome, IE 10-11, or Firefox. But, if the organisations insist on older (nn-HTML5) browsers, due to compliance issues, the entire work may be futile. However, MediaElement.js, Modernizr are the development solutions for this issue. <br><br>

          However, it is easier if the developers are aware about the different user-agent strings that will be returned for each targeted device-browser-platform combination, to make things easier.<br><br>

          <strong>#4-Screen Resolutions</strong><br><br>
          HTML5 may have rewritten the way eLearning is viewed on various devices, however getting it right on various devices sizes, screen resolutions and orientations is quite a challenge. Different screen resolutions require different size of images- i.e. higher resolution for desktops and low resolution for mobile devices. However, the use of SVG (scalable vector graphics)- an HTML5 technology allows vector images to be displayed using code, rendering clear image irrespective of the resolution of a user’s screen, quite useful in case of multi device solutions.<br><br>
          
          Different Media formats, HTML5 standards that are constantly upgraded, and cross-device testing etc. pose challenges too, however those issues are quite subjective considering the advancement of authoring tools. The challenges discussed above can even vary from project to project. The key to face the challenges head-on is to observe, take note of the experiences and keep improving. <br><br>

          <div class="blogHeading">Can eLearning Save Time and Cost for Small-medium Size Companies?</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          eLearning, electronic learning or online learning has been widely adopted globally and by organisations with large employee strength mostly owing to the expanse of its outreach and cost-effectiveness. However, Small-medium sized companies (SMEs) have more than often shied away from the prospect of introducing an eLearning-based training environment within the organisation. The fear of course fueled by the thought of Return of investment (ROI), weighing benefit in terms of time, effort etc. The primary question being-can eLearning save time and cost for SMEs? <br><br>

          A yes would definitely need explanation. So, before going there, let’s ponder upon the basic factors that hinder the adoption of eLearning in SMEs. <br><br>

          So, basically there is a misconception about eLearning in general (how is it better than instructor-led training?), that includes the:<br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>fear of cost and overhead for content maintenance</li><br>
            <li>lack of infrastructure</li><br>
            <li>unavailability of standard courses</li><br>
            <li>learning culture.</li><br>
          </ul>

          <p>The beauty of eLearning often lies in its flexibility and customisability. In addition, it also saves in terms of both time and cost.<br><br>

          <strong>Low Cost- Good Returns</strong> 
          Just evaluating eLearning just in terms of the money (expenditure)and profit earned doesn’t provide the conclusive answers. SMEs can get returns in different ways by the implementation of eLearning. Low cost authoring tools, save both time and money, and not just that such courses, influence productivity and in turn increase the overall profit. <br><br>

          <strong>In-house Development-Quick Solutions</strong> 
          SMEs often have different learning requirements. When bigger enterprises can easily use catalog courses, SMEs may need more custom solutions triggering the need for in-house content creation and development. eLearning Authoring tools assist in creating rapid, custom solutions without high-level coding skills or special training.  <br><br>

          <strong>Outsourcing-Cost Effectively</strong> 
          While in-house content creation has its own merits, outsourcing eLearning creation to experienced vendors can save both time and money. SMEs can implement apt solutions by providing the eLearning vendors the freedom and flexibility to conceptualise the right solution from the beginning. <br><br>
        
          As discussed in the research paper titled- <a href="https://eleed.campussource.de/archive/2/236" target="_blank" style="color: blue">eLearning - A Chance for Small And Medium Sized Enterprises</a>, eLearning alone may not be the right solution for SMEs, a blended approach can balance and optimise the cost and time for development and deployment of Learning programs. The different approaches could be:<br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>to blend individual, self-paced learning with interactive trainer support in face-to-face contact, e-mail, discussion forum, etc. to develop individual knowledge and skills,</li><br>
            <li>to blend different delivery media and to organise learning events in order to develop specific behaviour and attitude and,</li><br>
            <li>to blend different delivery media and to organise learning events with mentoring to develop workplace competence.</li><br>
          </ul><br><br>


         <p> However, as the paper points out the success of eLearning in SMEs and its cost effectiveness often depends on the quality of analysis and need assessment. “A strategy should begin with a thorough and clear analysis of the learner's situation and of the training targets for which blended learning can be applied. The three important phases are:<br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>analysis,</li><br>
            <li>implementation in a timely and cost-effective manner and,</li><br>
            <li>testing how maximum learning can be obtained through effective integration of different media and methods.”</li><br>
          </ul><br><br>
          
          <p>
          eLearning as in any organisation can only be effective if it becomes a part of the work culture. Its cost-effectiveness hence, lies in developing a good learning culture within SMEs, that can foster independent, self-paced learning.

          <div class="blogHeading">Can the Impact of Compliance Training Be Increased If Delivered in Digital Mode?</div>
          <div class="introImage"></div>

          <p>
          Compliance Training! The same old boring norms and long list of rules to follow. Usually the first thought that buzzes through our minds when it comes to compliance training is that it is boring. Well, no argument on that. Compliance training is usually a legal and operational responsibility and for years it has been equated to thick volumes, with elaborate text. But, with the shift in the whole corporate training scenario, it no longer has to be so.<br><br>

          Digital training is the new and effective way to deliver learning, but would it also increase the impact too? Firstly, let’s look at how digital mode can make compliance training better. <br><br>

          <strong>1. Increased Outreach</strong><br><br>
          With the current internet connectivity, accessibility on multiple devices, unlimited scope for language translation etc. compliance training in digital mode can be delivered to multiple learners at the same time across the globe, and all that without travelling, gathering at single location and without loss of consistency. This can be compliance training’s global impact if converted to digital form.<br><br>

          <strong>2. Effectiveness</strong><br><br>
          Most organisations opt for digital training to improve effectiveness and efficiency and to have a competitive edge over the others. As compliance is a crucial aspect when it comes to certain businesses, using digital version can assist in enhancing quality, in training employees for new roles, and in increasing the speed of deployment of new systems and processes. <br><br>

          Digital learning assists learners to adopt to swift changes in a cost-effective manner. <br><br>

          <strong>3. Faster Updates</strong><br><br>
          Compliances standards are often updated but reflecting the updates almost immediately in a classroom setting which includes all the hassles of scheduling, assembling the trainees, finding the instructor, rescheduling according to learner’s convenience etc. is an arduous task. Whereas updates in digital mode can be updated easily, even more so if it is web-based or on cloud. <br><br>

          However, for the impact of digital mode to be real, directly transforming the content to digital version maybe not be the answer. This may require certain design considerations that can surely improve the effectiveness of digital compliance training. A few of which include:<br><br>

          <i>Using Videos and Media Elements:</i> Using videos for compliance training can encourage even the reluctant learners to participate. The right combination of audio and visuals can convey a large amount of information in a short time, that too without affecting the quality. Owing to the multi device nature of videos it can be delivered, anywhere, anytime at the learner’s convenience. <br><br>

          <i>Scenarios and Examples:</i> Digital compliance training can have better impact when good scenarios and real-life examples are used for explanation. Examples can help the learners to understand the actual impact of that the behavioural change could bring and hence, influence their compliance with the suggested rules/regulations.  <br><br>
        
          Game-based Learning, Interactives etc. too can increase the impact of compliance training. And not just that, using digital mode/ eLearning as it is otherwise known also makes tracking, assessments, analytics etc. easier.  <br><br>

          Compliance training may be mandatory, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be boring too. With the use of appropriate learning models, strategies and interactive elements, interesting and innovative compliance training can be created and delivered in the digital mode. And the best part is that with the help of experts this can be done easily and cost effectively too. <br><br>

          So, are you ready to take compliance training to the digital platform?
